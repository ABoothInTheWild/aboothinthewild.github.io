	<p>Alexander Booth currently works as a full-stack web developer and analyst. He resides in Dallas, Texas. Feel free to connect on LinkedIn or Twitter!</p>

	<p>Besides working as a full-time software developer and data analyst, he is a passionate teaching assistant of Data Science at SMU. His previous education includes a M.S. in Data Science from Northwestern University, and a Bachelor’s Degree in Statistics from Washington University in St. Louis.</p>

	<p>Usually he can be found enjoying a craft beer or artisan coffee and spiritedly debating whether or not baseballs were juiced last season to anyone that pretends to listen. Connect with me on LinkedIn and I’ll tell you why Buck Showalter did not play the best reliever in baseball, Zach Britton, in a tie game in the single elimination Wild Card game.​</p>
